i got it.

yes you are correct.

yay! i got it.


this is through gui.


this is another trial using code. it works. this it it.

so you need to use the message option. you need to write a message before commiting.
so in brief the step is as follows: 
1) make changes
2) add it to git using git add .
> git add . 
<b> the . represents all </b>
3) then commit -m "write a message"
> git commit -m "my message"
<b> This sends this to the stage phase </b>
4) then push it to the github 
> git push origin main
<b>This updates the file in the github</b>

okay now lets practice how to pull changes from the repository / github
i made the changes i saved it here now pull this edits from your computer
